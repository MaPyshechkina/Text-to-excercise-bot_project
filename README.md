**NLP Bot for Language Learning**

This project features an NLP bot that takes (1)educational texts from users and generates (2)exercises of varying difficulty (3)levels.

1. Educational Texts: These are narratives, dialogues, and stories from Russian as a Foreign Language (RFL) textbooks designed for beginners learning Russian.
2. Exercises: The exercises focus on practicing forms and meanings across different grammatical cases. After processing the text, the user receives sentences in which lemmatized nouns in case X or all cases are enclosed in parentheses. For example: В 12 (час) президент поздравляет нас по телевизору. Он желает нам (счастье) и (здоровье). Потом мы пьём шампанское и смотрим салют.
3. The level of complexity can be determined by a list of words with a rarer declension paradigm.
